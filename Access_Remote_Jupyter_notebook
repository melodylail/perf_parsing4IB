Jupyter Notebook Server SSH Tunneling

A Jupyter notebook server can be accessed using SSH tunnelling. Since a Jupyter notebook server belongs to the user that started it, you'll need to make a few changes to its configuration before proceeding.
First, edit your notebook configuration. It lives in ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py (if it's not there you'll want to install and start Jupyter once to create it):
## The port the notebook server will listen on.
## It's probably best to consult with other lab members before picking a port 
## number--most numbers in the 9000s should work.
c.NotebookApp.port = 9000

## The IP address the notebook server will listen on.
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'

Next, start the notebook server in the directory where your notebooks live, or at least in your user directory structure (~/):
~/my_notebooks$ jupyter notebook

Once the server has been started you can SSH tunnel to the port you picked on the server (e.g. 9000 above):
ssh -N -L 9000:SERVER_ADDRESS:9000 USER@SERVER_ADDRESS

Finally, visit the URL in your web browser: http://localhost:9000/


在windows上通过Cmder，运行
ssh -N -L 9000:10.10.108.147:9000 luq@10.10.108.147
